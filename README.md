<h1>Game blog API project</h1>

**This project is v2 of my previous project.**

To run this project you need:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your terminal and `cd` project's directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Then make migrations with command `python manage.py makemigrations`.
5. Migrate to your db `python manage.py migrate`.
6. Run server `python manage.py runserver`.
7. Send API requests to **<a>localhost:8000/api/</a>**.

This is the simplest API, so don't expect something incredible :)
